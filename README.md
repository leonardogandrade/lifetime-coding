# Lifetime coding

## About this repository

This is my personal practical study guide for things that I have to learn
in my daily life. It's not a big deal, just a bunch of code to practice
important concepts.
Here you can find a summarized explanation about the algorithm theory and
a commented code to see and understand theory.
Once ago I read a quote signed to Dr. Richard Feynman, who was a
physicist, where he stated: "if you cannot explain something in simple
terms, you don't understand it." Thinking this way I tried to explain
in a short simple way the theory behind.
Another very helpful topic that you can find here is a collection of
interview-challenges which you can read the description, try your self
and find out a reference code.
Take a look at the listed resources below:

1.  Data structures

    - Stacks
    - Linked lists

2.  Searching algorithms

    - Binary search

3.  Gihub

    - Basic commands
    - Advanced techniques

4.  Tests
    - Unit tests
    - integrated tests
5.  Interview code challenges
